🌱 **Currently**  
I'm completing my degree at **Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona**, where I’ve focused on:
- Data analysis with Python and R  
- Machine learning and deep learning  
- Computer vision and image processing  
- Statistical modeling and dashboards

🔬 **Experience**  
I’m gaining hands-on experience in the pharmaceutical industry at **HIPRA**, where I apply data science and AI tools to research and development projects involving images, health data, and real-time monitoring tools.

👯 I’m eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of machine learning and data science.
